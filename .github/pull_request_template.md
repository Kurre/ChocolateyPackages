!! -- This repo is terribly out of sync and out of date. -- !!

PLEASE do NOT create pull requests. They can't be used as I do not pull from here and the PR will be closed.

Instead please just contact me with the changes to be made and I'll insert them in my local files or you can create an issue and I'll copy and paste from that.

I REALLY appreciate your bravado and willingness to help. Unfortunately my repo is completely out of whack and needs to be fixed when I have time. (I'll probably just delete and re-push everything.)
